# Credit Card Fraud Detection

### **Task:** Examples represent 1 and 0 instances of Fraudulent and Genuine Transaction of European customers.
### **Trained Model:** 
[Model](), Training Time: --,  Accuracy: --  but note that 99.8% of the transactions were Genuine and 0.1667% were Fraudulent, so it likely that 99% of the time the model will predict the transaction as Genuine. So it is better we focus on other metrics such as f1-score, precision and recall since the dataset is imbalanced (--).
